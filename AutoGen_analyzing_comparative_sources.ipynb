This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n","Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n","\n","In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` to perform tasks which require acquiring info from the web:\n","* discuss a paper based on its URL.\n","* discuss about the stock market.\n","\n","Here `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. By setting `human_input_mode` properly, the `UserProxyAgent` can also prompt the user for feedback to `AssistantAgent`. For example, when `human_input_mode` is set to \"TERMINATE\", the `UserProxyAgent` will execute the code written by `AssistantAgent` directly and return the execution results (success or failure and corresponding outputs) to `AssistantAgent`, and prompt the user for feedback when the task is finished. When user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will directly pass the feedback to `AssistantAgent`.\n","\n","## Requirements\n","\n","AutoGen requires `Python>=3.8`.
